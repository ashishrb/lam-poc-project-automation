# Additional Use Cases

This proof of concept demonstrates several expanded scenarios for the Autonomous LAM system:

1. **Leadership Dashboard** – Executives can review real-time project updates from all teams in a single consolidated view.
2. **Developer Daily Updates** – Team members log daily progress and blockers, creating an audit trail for each project.
3. **Automated Project Tracking** – Submitted updates feed the system to trigger automated project management workflows.
4. **Historical Reporting** – All updates are stored in SQLite for later analysis and performance reviews.

These cases highlight how the project evolves into an end-to-end management platform with minimal manual oversight.
